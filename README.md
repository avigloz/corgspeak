A language for, and (probably?) by corgis.

*corgspeak → english coming soon!*

### corgspeak v1 standards:

- English words 2 characters or less stay the same.
- English words greater than 2 and up to 4 characters become the first 2 characters of the word repeated twice (e.g "cake" → "caca")
- English words 5 characters or greater become the first 3 characters of the word repeated twice (e.g "swaggy" → "swaswa")
- Currently the only exceptions are:
  - "corgi" → "corgcorg"
  - "julia" → "juju"
